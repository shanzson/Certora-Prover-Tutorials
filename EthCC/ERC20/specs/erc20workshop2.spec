/**** Exercises ****/

/// We have been considering the question: If there is a change in `allowance`, 
/// what else must necessarily be the case?

/// Now consider the question: If there is a change in token balance, what else 
/// must necessarily be the case?

/// Using what weâ€™ve learned, write some parametric rules to test whether the
